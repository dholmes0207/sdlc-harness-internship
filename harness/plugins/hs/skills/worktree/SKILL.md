# hs:worktree — isolated git worktrees

Manage git worktrees using the native `git worktree` CLI — no script wrapper needed. Use to run two branches in parallel without affecting each other (isolated dev).

## Command table

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `create <feature>` | Create a new worktree on a new branch |
| `list` | List all worktrees |
| `status` | Check health and divergence from the base branch |
| `remove <name>` | Delete a worktree (clean up metadata) |
| `prune [--dry-run]` | Clean up stale metadata (`--dry-run` to preview) |

## Opt-in advanced CLI (`scripts/worktree.cjs`)

The default path above is plain `git worktree` — enough for most cases. For monorepo/submodule-aware automation the skill bundles an **opt-in** Node CLI at `scripts/worktree.cjs`: monorepo + submodule detection, per-project `.env` copy (gated by `isSafeEnvFileName` — refuses traversal/absolute/subdir names so real secrets outside the project root are never copied), ahead/behind divergence, and
`--json` output for scripting.

```bash
node "${HARNESS_BIN_ROOT:-.}"/harness/plugins/hs/skills/worktree/scripts/worktree.cjs info --json
node "${HARNESS_BIN_ROOT:-.}"/harness/plugins/hs/skills/worktree/scripts/worktree.cjs create <feature> [--project <name>]
```

It does NOT replace the built-in `EnterWorktree`/`ExitWorktree` flow or the native commands below — reach for it only when monorepo/submodule project resolution or `.env` automation is actually needed.

## Worktree creation procedure

### Step 1 — Identify base branch + slug

```bash
git symbolic-ref --short HEAD          # current branch
git branch -r | grep -E 'main|master|dev'  # find base if unclear
```

Prefix from description:
- "fix / bug / error" → `fix`
- "refactor / restructure" → `refactor`
- "docs / documentation" → `docs`
- "test / spec" → `test`
- "chore / cleanup / deps" → `chore`
- anything else → `feat`

Slug: convert to kebab-case, max 50 characters. Final branch name: `<prefix>/<slug>` (example: `feat/add-auth`).

If the user provides a full branch name (contains `/`, uppercase, ticket key like `ABC-1234`)
→ use it as-is, do not add a prefix.

### Step 2 — Create the worktree

```bash
# Worktree in a sibling directory (avoid nesting inside the current repo)
git worktree add "../<repo>-<slug>" -b "<branch>" <base-branch>
```

If the user specifies `--base <branch>` → override the base-branch.

**MUST** unset `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, `GIT_INDEX_FILE`, `GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY`, `GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES`, `GIT_COMMON_DIR`, `GIT_NAMESPACE` before running any git command inside a worktree — an inherited `GIT_*` var scoped to a different worktree makes git write to the wrong tree (silent corruption). See `references/isolation-rules.md`.

### Step 2.5 — Carry untracked harness config into the worktree

`git worktree add` shares tracked files through the common git-dir but never carries untracked / gitignored content. A per-project install can keep `harness/` and `.claude/` untracked in the host repo, so the fresh worktree would start without the harness wiring it needs. Copy them in:

```bash
python3 "${HARNESS_BIN_ROOT:-.}/harness/plugins/hs/skills/worktree/scripts/carry_untracked.py" \
  --source "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" --dest "<worktree-path>"
```

Carry rule: an entry is copied **only when git cannot** — it has no tracked files under it. A tracked `harness/` is left to git (its ignored `state/`/pycache noise is never dragged); a fully untracked `harness/` or the ignored `.claude/` is copied wholesale. Advisory — always exits 0, so a failed carry never blocks worktree creation.

Carry-list precedence: `--carry <a:b>` flag > `$HARNESS_WORKTREE_CARRY` (colon-separated) > shipped default `harness:.claude`. Set `HARNESS_WORKTREE_CARRY` to add repo-local paths a specific checkout needs carried; keep those out of the shipped skill.

**A Claude-Code-native worktree carries itself.** EnterWorktree, subagent
worktree-isolation, `--worktree`, and the desktop app copy every path matching the
shipped `.worktreeinclude` (the harness runtime subtree + `.claude/settings.json`)
into the new worktree automatically — so those paths never start un-wired.
`carry_untracked.py` above is now the **safety net for a manual `git worktree add`**
typed outside Claude Code, the one creation path `.worktreeinclude` cannot reach.
Runtime **state resolves to the HOST** (a linked worktree redirects `state/` back to
the host repo), so worktrees no longer fragment or lose trace/telemetry — see
`references/isolation-rules.md`.

### Step 3 — Install dependencies (if needed)

Run in the background inside the new worktree:

| Lock file | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| `poetry.lock` | `poetry install` |
| `requirements.txt` | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| `pyproject.toml` (no poetry.lock) | `pip install -e .` |

### Step 4 — Confirm + remove / clean up

**MUST** verify the branch with an exact-match check before `--force`/`remove` — a fuzzy match (e.g. `grep feature`) also passes on `feature-old`, risking the wrong tree:

```bash
[ "$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)" = "<expected-branch>" ] || { echo "wrong branch"; exit 1; }
git worktree list                         # confirm creation succeeded
git worktree remove <path>                # clean removal (fails if dirty)
git worktree remove --force <path>        # only when user confirms discarding uncommitted changes
git worktree prune --dry-run && git worktree prune  # clean stale metadata
```

Report: absolute path + branch name.

## Output

```
✓ worktree: /absolute/path/to/<slug>  (branch: feat/<slug>)
✓ base: main (auto-detected)
✓ list: 2 worktrees
```

## Error handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Branch already exists | Ask user: reuse existing branch or use a different name |
| Path conflict | Suggest an alternative path |
| `remove` on dirty worktree | Warn about uncommitted changes — require user confirmation before `--force` |
| Not a git repository | Stop + guide to `git init` or check cwd |

## HARD-GATE (real wiring)

No dedicated harness gate for worktrees — `git worktree` is the native CLI. Pushes from inside the worktree go through the **pre-push hook** `harness/install/git-pre-push-hook.sh` exactly as in the main checkout: calls `artifact_check.check_stage("push", root)` — missing artifact → exit 2, push blocked. Do not bypass the hook to pass the gate.

## Boundaries

- Do NOT delete a worktree containing uncommitted changes without asking the user first.
- Do NOT create a worktree nested inside the repo's `.git/` directory.
- Do NOT push from a worktree if the push gate has not passed — see `hs:git` for commit/push.
- YAGNI applies: do not initialize submodules, remotes, or new config outside the request scope.
- When commit/push inside the worktree is needed → invoke `hs:git`.

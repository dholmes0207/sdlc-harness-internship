"""mutation_matrix.py — deterministic 3-layer mutation matrix from eval_config.json.

Meta-tests the eval GATE itself (check_p0_gates + the maturity/threshold
verdict), not the pipeline under eval. The unit broken is a SCORED AXIS (any
field/label/measure that feeds the verdict, not just an extraction field);
the layer broken is EVIDENCE (a copy of ground truth, or a synthetic result
list fed straight into score()) — never the running system.

Three layers, each with a falsifiable expectation:
  p0        — violate one p0_rules[i] -> the gate MUST block (exit 1),
              regardless of the overall maturity score.
  threshold — push the composite maturity to exactly threshold-epsilon
              (must exit 1) and threshold+epsilon (must exit 0), for every
              key in the card's epsilon map.
  noise     — perturb a non-p0 field so it still matches after the runner's
              generic normalize (case/whitespace only) -> the gate MUST NOT
              panic (exit 0).

Coverage-first: every p0 rule must carry >=1 mutation that can kill it — a
card mutation entry (case_matrix[].mutations[] with kills == "p0:<i>") takes
priority; otherwise a rule with a `target_axis` gets a mechanically derived
gt-mutation. A rule with NEITHER is UNKILLABLE and `generate` refuses (exit
4) rather than silently under-covering — an unkillable rule is an unproven
rule.

target_axis contract (this generator's own reading, since the schema leaves it opaque):
this generator treats `target_axis` as the NAME of a `case_matrix[].expect`
field (equivalently a `ground_truth.json` items[].ground_truth key) — the
same field the generic runner (runner.py.tmpl) compares per-case. A rule
without a target_axis can still be covered via a card-declared mutation
using ANY vehicle.

Three vehicles:
  code   — break the SOURCE itself (the pipeline_mirror or the check_p0_gates
           body), from a reviewer-approved patch point on the card
           (code_mutations[]): the gt/record vehicles break EVIDENCE fed into
           the gate, this one breaks the gate's own code so a mirror/scorer
           that never actually enforces its rule is caught. Deterministic —
           the generator only COPIES the approved patch, it never invents one.
  gt     — copy ground_truth.json, patch one case's one field, run the
           stamped run_production_evals.py as a real subprocess, compare its
           exit code (same pattern as harness/e2e/run_eval_bootstrap_slice.py
           slice1: block-then-pass via subprocess, not import-cheating).
  record — for an axis with no ground-truth file (a threshold/epsilon probe,
           or a measured axis), a generated driver imports the domain's
           scorer.py and monkeypatches score_dimension to a fixed, mechanically
           derived value per dimension (uniform across dimensions works
           because DIMENSIONS weights always sum to 100 — see
           _gen_threshold_mutations), then calls score([]) and exits on
           `passed`. The driver + a copy of scorer.py/config_integrity.py run
           from a NESTED evals/eval_types/<domain>/ tree (card at
           evals/eval_config.json) inside a temp workspace, because
           config_integrity's `load_verified_config()` resolves the card via
           `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]` — a flat scratch dir cannot
           satisfy that.

Exit codes (generate): 0 matrix written / 2 input error (bad config, hash
mismatch, malformed matrix) / 4 coverage fail (an unkillable p0 rule).
Exit codes (run): 0 every mutation matched its expectation (and the
control-baseline case passed cleanly) / 1 a mismatch — a "blind" gate (a
kill mutation that did NOT trip the expected exit 1) or a "panicky" gate (a
noise/plus mutation that wrongly tripped a red) / 2 input error (config
drift against the matrix's card_hash, missing files, bad matrix JSON).

Determinism: no randomness, no wall-clock in the matrix bytes; iteration
order is always over explicit sorted keys or the card's own list order, so
two `generate` runs on the same config produce byte-identical output.

Rule-id attribution: the domain's check_p0_gates() must return
`(passed: bool, failures: list[dict])` where each failure carries an int
`rule_index` (pinned by test_config_conformance.py.tmpl). `run` greps
the stamped CLI's stdout ("P0 FAILURE: {'rule_index': N, ...}" from
print_report) for `rule_index` occurrences and asserts the mutation for
rule[i] actually surfaces rule_index==i, not a different rule borrowing the
kill.

Env: every subprocess gets an explicit env dict with all HARNESS_* keys
scrubbed (a leaked dev-override env would corrupt the run's own posture —
memory dev-env-leak). `run` also self-proves this via a one-line probe
subprocess whose result lands in the report's meta.

Stdlib only; paths resolve off __file__ (none used directly, but no
sibling/harness/scripts import — this script never imports outside its own
skill, same discipline as eval_scaffold.py / eval_config.py).

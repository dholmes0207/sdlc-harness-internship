# Workflow handoffs (on-demand)

Handoff table between SDLC steps -- who receives what, what is handed over, where to stop.
Matches `harness/data/skill-chains.yaml` (lens: declared-vs-actual).

| # | From -> To | Handover | Pass condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | idea -> hs:plan | problem description + constraints | standards loaded |
| 2 | hs:plan -> red-team | plan.md + phases | plan fully written |
| 3 | red-team -> validate | disposition table Accept/Reject | findings with evidence processed |
| 4 | validate -> HUMAN reviewer | Validation Log, Failed: 0 | all blocking questions finalized |
| 5 | HUMAN reviewer -> hs:cook | plan approved + DECs recorded | explicit approval (all autonomy stops here) |
| 5a | HUMAN reviewer -> hs:afk | plan approved + DECs recorded | unattended (AFK) variant of #5: replaces manual cook with an unattended loop; still requires explicit approval at the front, human re-reviews at the tail (#5b) |
| 5b | hs:afk -> hs:test | code + unattended commit loop | relevant suite green; human verifies before ship (counterpart of #6 for the unattended branch) |
| 6 | hs:cook -> hs:test | code + TDD tests per-phase | relevant suite green |
| 7 | hs:test -> hs:cook | QA report, ALL failures listed | any failure -> fix loop (#6/#7) |
| 8 | hs:test -> artifact | verification.json verdict | 100% pass (PASS) |
| 9 | hs:cook -> hs:code-review | implemented code (pending changes / branch) | implementation done -> review before ship |
| 9a | hs:code-review -> artifact | review-decision.json | verdict PASS required for hard stage |
| 9b | hs:code-review -> hs:git | review-decision.json verdict PASS | review PASS -> commit/push |
| 10 | artifact -> ship | gate_stage reads artifacts | gate pass; ship is the second HUMAN checkpoint |

Enterprise delta: handoff 10 connects to GitLab MR (the `ticket_id` seam already
exists in the schema). (Personal-first posture: there is NO reviewer role/quorum
gate on 9a — review is self-approval; the old `team.yaml`/`roles-policy.yaml`
role-check machinery was removed.)

**Handoff #5 -- context isolation:** between "HUMAN reviewer"
and "hs:cook", RECOMMENDED to `/clear` so cook runs from a clean context
(planning carryover -- research/red-team/debate -- skews cook). hs:plan returns
an **ABSOLUTE PATH** so the post-`/clear` session can still locate the plan.
Nudge `cook_isolation_nudge` (advisory, fail-open) fires when hs:plan + hs:cook
are detected in the same session (best-effort). This is a recommendation, NOT a
gate -- it does not block cook.

**Handoff #5 -- flag propagation (discover -> plan -> cook):** the mode/flag
decision is made ONCE (in discover's scope read or plan's mode step) and then
mirrored down the chain mechanically -- a receiving skill never re-decides it.
Three carry rules, each surfaced to the user (do not carry silently -- the user
must see which mode is being run and why):

- **discover -> plan, three tiers.** discover routes the plan command by brief
  scope: complex / multi-step / wide file surface -> `--hard --deep --tdd`;
  ordinary feature/refactor -> `--hard --tdd`; tiny (typo / one-line / docs /
  no testable code) -> `--fast` (drop `--tdd`). State the tier + reason, emit one
  command.
- **plan -> cook, `--tdd` mirrors the plan.** A `--tdd` plan (the default) MUST
  produce a cook command carrying `--tdd`; only a `--fast`/no-test plan drops it.
  `--hard`/`--fast`/`--deep` are plan-only and are NOT passed to cook.
- **plan -> cook, `--parallel` is a DUAL recommendation.** When the plan is
  parallel-capable (it emitted the dependency matrix + file-ownership table), the
  handoff prints BOTH the parallel and the sequential cook command plus a one-line
  risk read recommending one: disjoint ownership, no core/shared surface ->
  recommend parallel (the integration barrier still runs the full suite serially);
  any batch touching core / shared config / migration / hot module -> recommend
  sequential but STILL print the parallel line so the user can override with eyes
  open. A plan with no dependency matrix is sequential-only -- omit the parallel
  line. cook's own `--parallel` resolver (`cook_parallel_plan.py`) is the final
  arbiter and re-demotes any overlapping batch regardless of the flag; the handoff
  recommendation never weakens that.

## Orchestrator pre/parallel handoffs

Orchestrator discover/understand/triage connect into chain 1-10 above, numbers
unchanged:

| From -> To | Handover | Pass condition |
|---|---|---|
| hs:discover -> hs:plan | discovery brief (problem + evidence + chosen direction + open questions + out-of-scope) | brief finalized; RECOMMENDED /clear between discovery<->plan -- nudge `discover_isolation_nudge` (advisory, default OFF) |
| hs:understand -> hs:plan/hs:triage | codebase map (read-only) | map sufficient for design/localization; do NOT modify code |
| hs:triage -> hs:fix | triaged defect + repro (localized) | severity not architectural -> fast-path |
| hs:triage -> hs:plan | defect affects architecture / 3+ failing hypotheses | escalate to full pipeline instead of fast-fix |
| hs:techstack -> hs:test | detected stack (languages, test_cmd, package manager) | non-Python target -> detect the real test command before running test (do NOT assume pytest) |
| hs:security-scan -> hs:code-review | security findings + proposed fixes | findings triaged -> review the fixes before they ship |
| hs:afk | unattended branch of the plan->test pipeline: inserted between #5 and #6 (rows #5a/#5b in table above) | plan approved; loop commits freely in the middle, human reviews at both ends (#5a entry, #5b exit) |
| hs:discover/research/triage/cook/predict -> hs:bakeoff | ≥2 measurable candidate directions + a mechanical metric, reasoning can't separate them | preconditions hold (else fall back to hs:predict) — escalation, not a default step |

**Composite-source notation:** the `discover/research/triage/cook/predict -> hs:bakeoff`
row above is shorthand for five independent handoffs — each listed source hands off to
`hs:bakeoff` on its own (it is NOT a sequence through the listed skills). The slash
separates alternative sources, not pipeline steps.

| hs:bakeoff -> hs:plan/hs:cook | verdict (winner + full scoreboard) OR tie_within_noise→human | verdict written; winner is outside the noise band (tie/insufficient -> hand to human, do NOT proceed) |
| hs:plan/hs:discover -> hs:critique | artifact under critique (plan / chosen direction) + scope | lenses fan out (batched ≤2), consolidated to one verdict; gate mode also writes `critique-consensus.json` (advisory by default — enforcement OFF until a stage opts the kind into `stage-policy.yaml` `requires:`, a write-guarded human edit) |
| hs:docs-scaffold -> hs:docs-standardize | stub skeleton (frontmatter + headings + TBD) | required-set stubbed -> validate structure (frontmatter/id/graph) before content |
| hs:docs-standardize -> hs:docs-build | structure artifact PASS (docs-check.json, 0 errors) | gate green -> render showcase HTML + flat-md/pdf/excel releases |

`hs:triage` reuses fix-loop #6/#7 and the same gate `verification.json` #8 -- does not create a new gate.
`hs:afk` does NOT create a new gate: routes Ralph sandbox | fallback native, still stops at both human-reviewer endpoints (#5a/#5b) and verifies via `verification.json` #8.
Matches `harness/data/skill-chains.yaml` (4 chains added accordingly). Archetype contract: the Orchestrator skill contract section below.

---

## Orchestrator skill contract

Contract for **orchestrator**-type skills -- skills that compose multiple `hs:*`
meta-skills into a fixed workflow (hs:cook, hs:plan, hs:discover, hs:triage,
hs:understand, hs:afk). Unlike leaf skills (one task each), orchestrators
COORDINATE other skills. Load this section when writing or editing an orchestrator,
or when reviewing a handoff chain.

### Invariants

1. **Clear input contract.** An orchestrator declares what input it needs
   (hs:cook needs an approved plan; hs:triage needs a defect description;
   hs:discover needs an idea + constraints). Missing input -> return to the
   upstream skill or ask the human; do NOT guess.
2. **Chain-by-name.** Invoke component skills BY NAME (`hs:research`, `hs:fix`...),
   do NOT import the code/hooks of another skill, do NOT copy their logic into
   yourself. Each component skill keeps its own boundaries + gate. Circular
   coordination is forbidden.
3. **Gate-vs-handoff** -- distinguish clearly which type of output is produced:
   - **Gate (hard):** only when the orchestrator GENERATES a machine-readable
     artifact that a gate can read (hs:triage/hs:cook -> `verification.json` via
     `harness/hooks/gate_stage.py`; review -> `review-decision.json`).
     When a suitable gate already exists -> **REUSE IT**, do not create a new gate.
   - **Handoff (soft):** orchestrator only produces documentation/handover
     (hs:discover -> brief, hs:understand -> map) -> do NOT claim a hard-gate;
     connect onward via the handoff table above +
     `harness/data/skill-chains.yaml`.
4. **Do not bypass safety steps of component skills.** If hs:fix requires TDD
   red->green, an orchestrator calling hs:fix may NOT skip that step. Orchestrators
   coordinate; they do not "optimize" by cutting a child skill's gate.
5. **Context isolation for heavy handoffs.** Handoffs carrying substantial context
   (discovery, planning) -> recommend /clear, backed by the corresponding nudge
   (`discover_isolation_nudge` for discover->plan, `cook_isolation_nudge` for
   plan->cook). Nudges are advisory fail-open, default OFF, do NOT block.
6. **Out-of-scope -> `BACKLOG.md`**, do not steer the workflow mid-run.

### Registration (wiring into the harness)

- Add the chain pair to `harness/data/skill-chains.yaml` -- the workflow-chains lens
  compares declared-vs-actual telemetry; drift becomes data. (e.g. hs:afk declares
  `[hs:plan, hs:afk]` + `[hs:afk, hs:test]` -- the unattended branch of the
  plan->test pipeline.)
- Add a handoff row to the table above.
- Registration in the `owned` set is automatic and location-based: any dir with a
  `SKILL.md` under `harness/plugins/*/skills/` (`harness/scripts/catalog.py`).
- New nudge (if any): file `harness/hooks/*.py` with `HOOK_CLASS` constant +
  register in `harness/install/hooks-registration.yaml` + TDD tests. Details:
  `hs:harness-creator`.

### Name honesty

An orchestrator's name describes what it COORDINATES, not over-claiming the work
of component skills: hs:triage *triages + routes + gates* a defect -- the actual
fix is done by hs:fix; hs:discover *shapes* a problem into a brief -- the planning
is done by hs:plan.

"""harness_paths.py — single home for root + state-dir resolution.

Two roots, one shared binary serving many projects:

  bin_root()   — where the programs live (hooks, scripts, skills, rules, data
                 templates). Read-only at runtime for every actor. A global
                 install points every project at ONE bin.
  data_root()  — a project's private data home `.harness/`. All per-project
                 state, telemetry, trace, writeable config land here.

`root()` is kept as a back-compat alias for `bin_root()` so the shipped-binary
readers are untouched by the split. Resolution is PURE (no mkdir): writers own
their own mkdir, readers never create what they inspect.

Precedence (exact):
  bin_root():   HARNESS_BIN_ROOT > HARNESS_ROOT (legacy alias) > __file__-relative
                > upward walk(harness/manifest.json | harness/hooks/) > CWD
  data_root():  HARNESS_DATA_ROOT > CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.harness
                > (self-host, ONLY when HARNESS_BIN_ROOT UNSET) bin_root()/.harness
                > FAIL-CLOSED marker (caller-visible) — never a silent CWD
  state_dir():  HARNESS_STATE_DIR > data_root()/state
  tool_data_root(): data_root() strict tiers first; only under a global layout
                (HARNESS_BIN_ROOT set) with a still-unresolved result does a
                Bash-tool script walk up from CWD to its own project's
                `.harness/` — still unresolved -> the same FAIL-CLOSED marker.
  tool_state_dir(): HARNESS_STATE_DIR > tool_data_root()/state
  bin_state_dir(): bin_root()/harness/state   # install metadata, never project-side

FAIL-CLOSED (red-team F2/F5/F7): under a global layout (HARNESS_BIN_ROOT set) a
data_root() that cannot resolve a project returns the unresolved marker instead
of decaying to CWD — guards MUST treat it as "no project root" and BLOCK. Self-host
is detected by HARNESS_BIN_ROOT being UNSET (a global bin is itself a git checkout,
so a `.git` walk-up would wrongly collapse it). A data root whose parent is the
filesystem root (e.g. HARNESS_DATA_ROOT=/data) is not a real project (F7).

data_root()/state_dir() are STRICT-ONLY — no CWD walk, ever; a guard/hook always
calls these bare. The CWD walk-up lives ONLY behind the named tool_data_root()/
tool_state_dir() functions, for a tool invoked via the Bash tool (whose env
carries no CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR): a NAMED function keeps this trust boundary
grep-enforceable (an absence-guard on harness/hooks/ + fs_guard.py bans the
`tool_data_root`/`tool_state_dir` tokens outright) — a boolean opt-in on the
strict functions would not be lintable and nothing would stop a future guard
from passing True and widening its own fail-closed lane.

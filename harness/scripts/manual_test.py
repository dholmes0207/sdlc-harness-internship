"""manual_test.py — admissibility of a manual-test result.

The anti-fabrication floor: a telemetry-anchored
output proves "a real command ran and this is its real output" — it defeats pure
hallucination — but it does NOT prove the command exercised the right thing (an
agent with a shell can run a real command against the WRONG endpoint and cite a
real trace). So anchored is a FLOOR, never a correctness proof:

  - evidence_tier `claimed` (agent-written) is below the floor — never hard-admissible.
  - `anchored` is honored only when the cited anchor id is actually present in
    the manual-test anchor telemetry the hook wrote; a fabricated id is REJECTED.
  - a hard gate additionally needs a human charter CO-SIGN — a rostered reviewer
    distinct from the author. Anchored-without-co-sign stays SOFT.

This is presence + tamper-evidence, NOT authentication. The co-sign is the human
judgement the machine cannot supply; the anchor is the floor that makes pure
fabrication cost a real command run.

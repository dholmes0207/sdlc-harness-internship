# hs:insights — read-only usage insights

Aggregates the harness telemetry sinks (`harness/state/telemetry/*.jsonl`) through the read-only lens front-end and narrates what the numbers say, then proposes optimizations the user can act on. It NEVER mutates config, code, skills, or telemetry — every suggestion is advisory, and acting on one goes through the normal tools (`/hs:setup`, a skill edit, a backlog entry).

This is the telemetry twin of `hs:retro` (which reads git history). Use both for a full picture.

## Flow

1. **Gather** (read-only, deterministic):

   ```bash
   python3 "${HARNESS_BIN_ROOT:-.}"/harness/scripts/analyze_telemetry.py --lens all --days 30
   ```

   Add `--days N` to widen/narrow the window, `--lens skill_usage` (or `workflow`) for one lens, `--format json` to post-process. The command prints a `## NOT measured` block — read it: it lists what telemetry does NOT capture (cost, correctness, non-script wall-clock). Don't let a clean number read as full coverage.

2. **Respect the gates.** Each lens carries `gated` / `sufficient`. `gated: true` = below low-volume threshold — report raw counts, SUPPRESS recommendations (sparse data is noise); say so explicitly, don't over-read three data points.

3. **Narrate + propose.** For sufficient data, surface:
   - **Hot skills** — the most-invoked; candidates to keep fast and well-documented.
   - **Never-invoked owned skills** (`never_used_owned`) — trim/merge candidates. RAISE them; never auto-remove — may be new/seasonal/load-bearing-but-rare, ask before cutting.
   - **Workflow chains** vs declared (`skill-chains.yaml`) — undeclared common chains may be worth
     declaring; declared-but-unused chains may be stale.
   - **Gate-block / bypass patterns** — recurring `write_guard_bypass` or gate blocks in
     `hook-telemetry.jsonl` suggest a detector that is too tight or a workflow papering over a gate.
   - **Session shape** (`--lens session`, over `sessions.jsonl`) — duration p50/p90, tool mix, files-modified + subagent totals, sessions/day: where the real time goes.
   - **Gate advisory/block trend** (`--lens gate`, over the gate trace) — pass / block / **advisory** / skip counts per stage + hook, with top block/advisory reasons. Personal-first: local advises, not blocks, so a rising `gate_advisory` count is the "how many receipt gaps would gate on remote" signal — surface it, don't treat it as a block.

4. **Hand off, do not act.** Config suggestion (voice, guard, roster, language) → point at `/hs:setup`; skill change → record via `backlog_register.py add`; stage/detector tuning → describe the change, let the user decide (detector loosening is a posture decision).

## Boundaries

- READ-ONLY: runs `analyze_telemetry.py` (never writes), reads JSONL sinks; must not edit telemetry, config, or code — producing a report is the whole job.
- Render reports per `harness/rules/output-rendering.md`: resolve `language` / `audience` / `humanize` live via `python3 "${HARNESS_BIN_ROOT:-.}"/harness/scripts/output_config.py --resolved` (never hand-read the tracked file); the rule holds the register behavior and the evidence-invariant fence.
- Never present a suggestion as a decision already made. The user adjudicates; the lens only counts.

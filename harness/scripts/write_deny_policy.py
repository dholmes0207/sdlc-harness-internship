"""write_deny_policy.py — deny-list policy SSOT (floor constants + soft loader).

The write-RBAC floor is a deny-list in two tiers. The HARD floor is a code
constant — author-maintained, never user-editable, because a user-editable
carve-out is a floor that widens itself:

  CORE_IMMUNE      absolute; no carve-out ever reopens it. Reuses
                   write_guard.GUARD_LIST (imported, NOT copied, so the two can
                   never drift) plus .git, a narrow secrets set, and the cage
                   self-disarm surface (.claude/settings*.json + the hooks slot).
  HARD_BINARY_DENY the installed harness binary (harness/**), carve-out only for
                   harness/tests/**. harness/state/** is deliberately NOT carved:
                   it is the audit store, and a shell/tool write there would let
                   an actor rewrite its own keyless chain_hash trail.

The SOFT tier is human-edited YAML, default EMPTY (= allow everything) — the
detective lane end users touch. Absent/empty config is inert, never a brick, the
opposite of the permission table whose absence fails closed.
